# Human Computer Interaction Project 1

This project is about critiquing an elevator of our chosing, finding the issues with the design and listing how we can make it better.

This repository contains a folder with the Processing file that creates the interface and operations it uses. Other files included are reference images to the original elevator, my redesign of said elevator, my critique of the original elevator in a text document, and an explanation of my redesign in the same format. 

To support my code, a gif of the interface in action is included to display what the design is capable of.
