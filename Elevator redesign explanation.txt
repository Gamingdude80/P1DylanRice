Elevator redesign explanation:
One improvement I made was to rotate the panel horizontally so that it could easier accessed by people in wheelchairs and shorter people, meaning they dont have to reach up so high to interact with buttons. I also moved the location for the braille for each button and made it so they are located in a spot where confusion about which button is what becomes much harder to do. I also moved the open and close door buttons away from the floor buttons so they are easy to find but located to where you cannot confuse them for floors. And importantly, I moved the alarm button to a place that is easy to find but is hard to accidentally press.
