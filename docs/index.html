    <p>This project is about critiquing an elevator for the good and bad aspects we can find and designing our own touch screen based elevator.</p>

	<p>Starting off with an elevator of my choosing, I took a photo of the panel and went through to see what parts were desirable and which parts would not be, as well as what could be improved with the design.</p>

	<p>Elevators are improved with better usability, and features such as audio and visual feedback, as well as intuitive layouts can lead to a much more streamlined usage and operation. More usability means more people are able to utilize the product, and in this case, more people can ride the elevator that may need it, such as the disabled and injured.</p>
	<p>Once I had decided what parts needed to be fixed and how they could be improved, I went and created my own sketch using principles such as better accessibility and more intuitive design.</p>

	<p>By making the panel horizontal and moving it lower down, people lower down can reach the interface easier. Changing the layout of the buttons and their location to reflect this, I made the door buttons seperate from the others so that people could not mistake them, and I moved the alarm button farther away so that it would be much harder to accidentally press when using the elevator.</p>

	<img class="img3" src="./P1DylanRice/P1DylanRice.gif" alt="Touch Screen Panel">
	<p>Taking some aspects from the original elevator, I came up with a design for a touch screen based elevator. This design features touch icons for each floor as well as indicators for the button being pressed. Beside these buttons are the open and close door buttons, as well as the panel section for displaying the current floor and which direction the elevator is traveling in. At the bottom of the design are two buttons located off of the screen, one to call the fire department and the other to stop the elevator. These buttons are physical in case the screen goes out and cannot be interacted with in an emergency situation.</p>
